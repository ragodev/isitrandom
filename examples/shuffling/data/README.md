Each `.shuffles` file contains the number of cards in each packet on either side of the shuffle.
The sum should equal 52, although there may be a few that are off because of poor counting (my own fault).

To generate a line in a file:

The deck of cards was riffle shuffled, but not pressed together. Starting from the top, the number of cards on one side was counted. Then the next top cards were counted (on the other side). This is continued all the way to the end. 

There is nothing special about the riffle shuffle, except that it is a normal shuffle for the person in hand.
